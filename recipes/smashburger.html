    <h1>The Ultimate Smash Burger</h1>

    <h2>Why this is the best homemade smash burger you will ever make</h2>
    <p>By placing a ball of meat on a hot, unoiled griddle and smashing it down firmly into a flat, thin disk, you greatly increase the contact points between the meat and the griddle, which in turn increases the Maillard reaction. That's the series of chemical reactions that create the rich brown crust that makes our steaks and burgers taste so freaking good. Maximum crust = maximum flavor = maximum craving.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted</li>
        <li>Condiments and toppings as desired, such as mayonnaise, mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles</li>
        <li>4 ounces (110g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two 2-ounce (55g) balls</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 slice good melting cheese, such as American, cheddar, or homemade melting cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
        <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
